# CharacterSearch

Searching characters are core of this app.

The search includes:
- prompts
- result when a character is found
- action when a character is not found

## Architecture

To ensure maximum flexibility we use a [compound pattern](https://javascriptpatterns.vercel.app/patterns/react-patterns/compound-pattern). This allows us free decide where in the layout to put different elements of the character search scope.
